Enterprise Agentic AI: Scalable Meeting Orchestration with n8n 

An Agentic AI–powered workflow built with n8n
, designed to automate meeting scheduling across an enterprise using OpenAI + Google Calendar.

This workflow demonstrates how Agentic AI can seamlessly integrate with enterprise tools to provide scalable, intelligent, and context-aware scheduling assistance. It can be adapted for broader enterprise use cases beyond just calendar automation.

📖 Introduction

In enterprise environments, scheduling meetings across teams can be repetitive and time-consuming. This repository provides a ready-to-use Agentic AI workflow in n8n that:

Acts as an AI-powered scheduling assistant

Reads availability from Google Calendar

Confirms timeslots interactively with users

Creates events automatically once finalized

It showcases how Agentic AI principles can be applied to real-world enterprise workflows.

🛠️ Workflow Overview

The workflow is composed of the following components:

Chat Input – Entry point for the user to interact with the assistant.

AI Agent – Orchestrates the conversation, manages tools, and ensures correct action flow.

OpenAI Chat Model – Provides reasoning and natural language capabilities (powered by gpt-4o-mini).

Simple Memory – Stores context across interactions.

Google Calendar Tools

Get Availability: Searches for free time slots.

Create Event: Books the meeting once a slot is confirmed.

⚙️ Scalability for Enterprise Applications

While this workflow focuses on meeting scheduling, the same architecture can be extended to other enterprise use cases:

Human Resources: Automate interview scheduling & reminders

Project Management: Book sprint reviews, stand-ups, and cross-team syncs

Customer Support: Schedule client calls, follow-ups, and escalations

Sales & Marketing: Auto-schedule demos, campaigns, and recurring check-ins

Scalability Features:

Plug-and-play integration with multiple calendars or services (Google Workspace, Microsoft Outlook, etc.)

Extendable with enterprise authentication (SSO, OAuth2)

Reusable Agentic AI pattern: chat input → memory → reasoning → tool execution

🚀 How to Deploy
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

2. Import Workflow into n8n

Open your n8n instance
.

Go to Workflows → Import from File.

Upload Agentic_AI_workflow.json from this repo.

3. Set Up Credentials

Configure your OpenAI API key under Credentials → OpenAI.

Configure your Google Calendar OAuth2 credentials under Credentials → Google Calendar.

4. Run the Workflow

Activate the workflow.

Start interacting with the chat input node.

The AI assistant will:

Fetch availability

Suggest slots

Book events automatically


💬 Example Conversation Flow

Here’s how a typical interaction looks once the workflow is deployed:

User:
"Can you schedule a 30-minute meeting with John tomorrow afternoon?"

AI Agent:
"Sure! Let me check your calendar for availability tomorrow afternoon..."

(Agent uses Google Calendar to fetch free slots)

AI Agent:
"You are free at 2:00 PM, 3:30 PM, and 4:15 PM. Which works best for you?"

User:
"Let’s go with 3:30 PM."

AI Agent:
"Perfect. Scheduling the meeting with John at 3:30 PM tomorrow. Do you want me to add a description?"

User:
"Yes — add 'Project Roadmap Discussion'."

AI Agent:
"Done! I’ve scheduled 'Project Roadmap Discussion' with John tomorrow at 3:30 PM, and added it to your Google Calendar."

    participant U as User
    participant A as AI Agent
    participant G as Google Calendar

    U->>A: "Can you schedule a 30-min meeting with John tomorrow?"
    A->>G: Check availability for tomorrow
    G-->>A: Free slots: 2:00 PM, 3:30 PM, 4:15 PM
    A-->>U: "You are free at 2:00, 3:30, and 4:15. Which works best?"
    U->>A: "Let’s go with 3:30 PM."
    A->>U: "Should I add a description?"
    U->>A: "Yes, 'Project Roadmap Discussion'."
    A->>G: Create event at 3:30 PM with description
    G-->>A: Event created
    A-->>U: "Meeting scheduled with John at 3:30 PM tomorrow."

3. Scheduled Event in Google Calendar

Once confirmed, the workflow creates a Google Calendar event automatically:




🚀 Demo Visuals

To help you understand how the Agentic AI Enterprise Calendar Assistant works, below are three complementary views of the workflow:

1. Workflow Flowchart (n8n Agentic AI Logic)

This flowchart shows the step-by-step workflow inside n8n — from user chat input to AI processing, checking calendar availability, and creating events.

2. Sequence Diagram (Agentic AI Interaction)

The sequence diagram illustrates the dynamic interaction between the user, AI agent, memory, and Google Calendar APIs.

3. High-Level Architecture (Enterprise Deployment View)

This architecture diagram explains how the workflow can be scaled in an enterprise environment, showing integration with n8n, OpenAI, Google Calendar, and possible extensions (ERP, CRM, HR systems).

👉 All three visuals provide different levels of understanding:

Flowchart → For workflow builders (low-code/no-code ops teams).

Sequence diagram → For developers and architects.

Architecture diagram → For enterprise decision-makers.
